P\+ID controller from Marc.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
P\+ID controller from Marc. 

This controller is based on the identification of the T\+TB. Without it, the velocity control has a huge delay.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em kp} & Double \+: proportional gain of the P\+ID \\
\hline
{\em kd} & Double \+: derivative gain of the P\+ID \\
\hline
{\em ki} & Double \+: integral gain of the P\+ID \\
\hline
{\em F\+R\+EQ} & Double \+: rate of the trajectory (and therefore the control law) \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
