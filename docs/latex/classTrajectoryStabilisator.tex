Control law that computes the desired velocities based on the trajectory (implemented by Marc Leyrat).  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Control law that computes the desired velocities based on the trajectory (implemented by Marc Leyrat). 

The control law is based on {\itshape }\{Bernard Bayle\textquotesingle{}s\}Â lessons on mobile robotics. They are available on the \href{http://eavr.u-strasbg.fr/~bernard/education/3a_robmob/3a_robmob.html}{\tt website of eavr}. This control law is based on a state feedback stabilizing admissible movements while controling the orientation of the robot. \begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
This control law is kinda obscur to me (G\+PA) \+: this class must be reviewed. Two control laws are computed \+: the first one is (u1, u2) and is only based on the system\textquotesingle{}s state. The second (v1, v2) is computed using the first control law and the robot\textquotesingle{}s orientation. 
\end{DoxyWarning}


The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
